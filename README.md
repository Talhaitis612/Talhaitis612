## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Talha, a Front-End Developer with a passion for Angular.

I have over a year of experience in building responsive and intuitive user interfaces using Angular, and I am constantly striving to expand my skill set and learn new technologies.

My ultimate goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer and beyond, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as I continue to grow in my career.

Here are some of the things I'm currently working on and interested in:

- Building robust and scalable applications using Angular, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Expanding my knowledge of back-end development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- Learning new front-end frameworks and libraries such as React and Vue.js.
- Exploring cloud-based technologies such as AWS and Azure.
- Contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers.

I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally, and I believe that continuous learning is the key to success in this field.

Feel free to check out my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to connect or collaborate on a project. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ™Œ
